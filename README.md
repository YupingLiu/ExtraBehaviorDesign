# ExtraBehaviorDesign #
EBD is a BTs tool which is based on the design of Opsive's Behavior Designer and extend it's functions for Unity developers.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
With EBD, AI developers can do sth. them can't in BD:  
1、Extend the BTs like adding or removing tasks in runtime.  
2、Serialize the BTs Asset staticly or dynamicly and translate the serialization info.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------
There must be bugs in EBD, and it is still incomplete. Bear with me.
